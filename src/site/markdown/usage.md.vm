#[[##]]# Prerequisites

* Java 11
    * see section [Why Java 11?](https://github.com/r0bb3n/sonar-quality-gate-maven-plugin#why-java-11) for details
* SonarQube (depends on mode)
    * integrated: 5.3+
    * simple: 5.4+
    * advanced: 7.7+

#[[##]]# Usage

Include the plugin declaration in your `pom.xml` either in `<build><pluginManagement><plugins>` for
calling it only explicitly on CLI or in `<build><plugins>` to integrate it automatically in your build.  

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</plugin>
```

You can also use it without changing your `pom.xml` by calling it fully qualified on CLI:

```
mvn ${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}:check
```
#[[###]]# Modes

#[[####]]# Integrated mode

Run in conjunction with sonar-maven-plugin (supports branches and pull requests)<br/>The required information for fetching the data will be read from a sonar-maven-plugin generated file in `target`.

```
mvn sonar:sonar sonar-quality-gate:check
```

#[[####]]# Simple mode

Run stand-alone for a simple SonarQube project (no branches).

```
mvn sonar-quality-gate:check
```

Ensure that there is no (old) metadata inside `target` from a former sonar-maven-plugin run 
(especially `target/sonar/report-task.txt`) otherwise it will switch automatically to **integrated** mode.

#[[####]]# Advanced mode

Run stand-alone for a SonarQube project with branch name ...

```
mvn sonar-quality-gate:check -Dsonar-quality-gate.branch=develop
```

... or pull request.

```
mvn sonar-quality-gate:check -Dsonar-quality-gate.pullRequest=59
```
